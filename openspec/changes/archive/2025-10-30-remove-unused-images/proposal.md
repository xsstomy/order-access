## Why
The `public/textimage/` folder contains unused image files that are not referenced in the main HTML file, increasing project size and creating maintenance overhead. Removing these unused files will improve project organization and reduce build/deployment size.

## What Changes
- Remove unused image files from `public/textimage/` folder
- Keep only the images that are actively used in `public/index.html`
- Document the cleanup process for future reference

## Impact
- Affected specs: None (pure maintenance task)
- Affected code: `public/textimage/` directory contents
- Expected size reduction: ~30MB of unused assets
- Risk: Low - only removing unused files
